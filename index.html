 <p> Princess,
From the day we met I knew I'd love you for
a lifetime. At the start of this all I honestly didn't think you would fall for me. It felt like fireworks going off the day you said yes to me. You should of seen how happy I was. Now we are 3 months in and I've never been happier. Everything about you is worth loving because I am proof that you can be loved over and over again by 1 person. 
Forever your teddy bear,
Evan</p>
